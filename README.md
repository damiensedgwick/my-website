# MUI NEXT
This is a modified version of the 
[material ui v5 + nextjs](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs) example.

I wanted to strip away the unnecessary scaffolding and provide a barebones setup for a nextjs app
with material ui v5 with typescript and a better folder structure.
